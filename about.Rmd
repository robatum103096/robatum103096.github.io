# About Me

I am currently a PhD student in biostatistics at Columbia University. My main research interests are applying and developing statistical methods to address problems in drug safety, effectiveness and utilization. I am particularly interested in confronting the opioid epidemic and other substance use disorders from a computational perspective.
